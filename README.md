# React Native + Expo + Typescript

## Setup and Run Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Expo CLI**: Install Expo CLI globally using npm or yarn:
  
```shell script

npm install -g expo-cli

```
OR

```shell script
yarn global add expo-cli
```

### Expo Go App

Install Expo Go: Install the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device. You can download it from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en&gl=US).


### Running the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

```shell script
git clone <https://github.com/oi19/Noaat.git>
```
   
2. Navigate to Project Directory: Change your current directory to the project folder:
   
```shell script
cd Noaat
```
   
3. Install Dependencies: Install project dependencies using npm or yarn:

```shell script
npm install 
```

  OR
  
```shell script
yarn install
```

4. Start Expo Metro Bundler: Start the Expo Metro Bundler:
    
```shell script
npx expo start
```

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

- If you want to add this new React Native code to an existing application, check out the [Integration guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/integration-with-existing-apps).
- If you're curious to learn more about React Native, check out the [Introduction to React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started).

# Troubleshooting

If you can't get this to work, see the [Troubleshooting](https://reactnative.dev/docs/troubleshooting) page.

# Learn More

To learn more about React Native, take a look at the following resources:

- [React Native Website](https://reactnative.dev) - learn more about React Native.
- [Getting Started](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) - an **overview** of React Native and how setup your environment.
- [Learn the Basics](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) - a **guided tour** of the React Native **basics**.
- [Blog](https://reactnative.dev/blog) - read the latest official React Native **Blog** posts.
- [`@facebook/react-native`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) - the Open Source; GitHub **repository** for React Native.

  

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!
